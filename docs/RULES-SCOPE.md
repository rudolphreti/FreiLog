# Scope (Prototype)

- Browser-only prototype.
- No backend, no server, no database.
- Data is stored as JSON and persisted in browser storage (default: localStorage).
- “Done” means:
  - Works after refresh
  - No console errors
  - Expected state persists after reload
  - UI stays consistent (Bootstrap)
